Mini is a small collection of interchangeable micro services, styles and spesifications for quickly prototypeing applications.

the ideal workflow would involve the description of some basic models and some views that update those views.

it should not solve all of your problems or provide unnessisary 'magic' that takes time to learn. 

it should favor the use of existing projects and libraries where a viable solution all ready exists.

the project as a whole should have no hard dependencies and should strive to be as simple as possible


component proposals:
	- basic styles library (layout, typography)
	- HTML Application spesification to reduce html-css-js coupling  
	- some kind of persistance abstraction (define schemas and you are good to go)
	- react-based ui component libary
	- higher level react components / mixins
	- generic server 
	- chat/socket stuff
	- data import / export tools (db,excell, wordpress, text)
	- user accounts
	- auto-api
	- distributed network (no central server)

	-task spesific packages
		- online game engine
		- cms
		- static pages
		- crud app
